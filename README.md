I created this website because I wanted to make a better killboard website for eve online. IT was a very big and ambitious project. Needless to say I didn't finish it. I ran into constant problems parsing very deep json data along with security implementations associated with posting. However I learned a lot on this project and it was fun. This was written in html, css, javascript, mysql, and vanilla php.

Requirements:
eve online static data export for mysql
eve online images; icons, renders, types
